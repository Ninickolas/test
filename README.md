<h1 align="center">Project Keno</h1>

## Project Description
<p align="left">This project is a simple simulatated version of the the game Keno, a popular gambling game similar to a bingo. In this game, the player will place his bet and choose up to twenty numbers between 0 and 80, inclusive, while the game generates other twenty random numbers, also on that same gap. Once all the numbers are chosen by the player, the game will check how many of the chosen numbers match the randomly generated ones, and give a payoff to the player based on that.</p>

## How to play
<p align="left">To run thos game, we will be needing a bet file, with the information of the players initial credits, the number of rounds that he wishes to play, and the numbers he has chosen to bet on.</p>
