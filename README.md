<h1 align="center">Project Keno</h1>

## Project Description
<p align="left">This project is a simple simulation of text-based version of the the game Keno, a popular gambling game similar to a bingo. In this game, the player will place his bet and choose up to twenty numbers between 0 and 80, inclusive, while the game generates other twenty random numbers, also on that same gap. Once the numbers are compared, the game will check how many of the chosen numbers match the randomly generated ones, and give a payoff to the player based on that.</p>
